# Alert on new scheduled task EventID 602

One method of detection would be to search for unusual host to host
network based logins. Windows logs these events at Type 3 Network logins or if using
Remote Desktop Protocol RDP then Type 10 Network logins (EventID 528|529|4624|4625).


## Processes
Alert on < windows_process_name > unless the path is correct.
Alert on svchost.exe unless its path is C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe
Alert on explorer.exe unless its path is C:\Windows\explorer.exe
Check especially for processes that has ProcessName starting with lower case (from cmd line)

“Most system processes have well defined parents; 
cmd.exe should not be the parent of lsass.exe. 
Most user processes are started by Explorer.exe. It’s suspicious when they’re not. 
Some system processes should never start programs; lsass.exe should not start cmd.exe”

new process created events is to sort them to show which processes are least frequently used. The least frequently used processes are by definition unusual.

Another possible indicator of an intrusion as referenced by the SANS Intrusion Discovery Cheat Sheet (SANS, n.d.) is a Windows File Protection (WFP) warning event (EventID 64004).

malware (and legitimate programs) to create persistence.
