Dear Winter Scripting Games participants.

- $_ repo is accessible via
https://github.com/sunnyc7/PhillyPosh

- I have taken the liberty of creating a private repo, so that all our code / sources remain private, while we collaborate and take a stab at the problem.
- I have already added all existing members of PhillyPosh to this private repo.
- I am going to recreate the repos created by Lido, and add them here.
